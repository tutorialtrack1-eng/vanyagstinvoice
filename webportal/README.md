# BlitzBook Web Portal

Browser version of the BlitzBook GST invoice Android app (`VanyaGSTInvoice`). Same screens, same
calculations, same print layouts, responsive from phone to desktop. No build step: plain HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. With the sync server running (`server/`), the app and the portal show the same books; without
it the data lives in the browser's local storage.

## Run it

- `node server/server.js` and open <http://localhost:8080/> — the portal and the sync server together, or
- double-click `index.html`, or serve the folder with any static server / web host. The portal then works
  on its own, or syncs with the Supabase project built into `js/sync.js`.

Register with a mobile number and password. The OTP comes by email from Supabase Auth (see
`server/supabase/README.md`) or by SMS and email from the sync server (`server/README.md`, *OTP delivery*);
with neither, the OTP is shown on screen (test mode). Forgot / Reset Password works the same way: the OTP goes to the mobile
number and email of the account, so a password can be reset from any device. A 1-day trial starts on
first login, after which an activation code is needed. With sync on, the account made in the app logs in
here and vice versa, and the trial and activation are shared.

## What is inside

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Entry page, loads the scripts below |
| `css/app.css` | Responsive styles: horizontal top navigation, gradient theme, tables that turn into cards on phones |
| `js/util.js` | Indian number format, amount in words, GSTIN / phone / email validation, invoice numbering, state list, UQC codes, HSN and bank lookups, Excel (.xlsx) reader |
| `js/store.js` | Local storage per user (parties, items, invoices, purchases, expenses, journal, notes, accounts) |
| `js/appformat.js` | The app's table layout: converts every record to and from the app's rows, for sync and for backup files |
| `js/supabase.js` | Supabase as the backend: Supabase Auth for accounts and OTPs, the `books` table for the records; answers the same requests as the sync server |
| `js/sync.js` | Keeps this browser and the app on the same books through Supabase or the sync server |
| `js/subscription.js` | Trial, plans, UPI link, activation server and codes (same SHA-256 scheme as the app, so `tools/LicenceKeyGen.java` codes work) |
| `js/print.js` | Printable documents: Standard (BlitzBook) and Classic boxed (Tally style) invoices, delivery challan, envelopes, purchase record / quotation, credit and debit notes, receipt / payment vouchers. Pages carry their own margins so the browser adds no header or footer to the PDF; long item lists repeat the table heading on every page |
| `js/app.js` | Shell, login / register / reset (with the sync server when there is one), dashboard, top navigation, company profile, backup, subscription, sync dialogs |
| `js/invoice.js` | New Invoice editor, quick item picker, Save and Print / PDF, Print Settings (layout previews, paper, envelopes), e-way bill warning, Sales list, Credit / Debit notes |
| `js/ledger.js` | Books (Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet with party-wise receivables / payables, stock figures; a port of Ledger.java), Customers / Suppliers, Item master, Purchases & Quotations, Expenses, Journal, Stock in hand |
| `js/money.js` | Receipts & Payments (kept as journal vouchers), receipt / payment voucher printout, bank statement upload |
| `js/reports.js` | Sales report, Profit & Loss, Balance sheet, period picker, Excel export |
| `js/gst.js` | GST returns: fetches a return period from the books and writes the GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B JSON files for the GST portal's offline tool (yearly plan or longer) |
| `js/companies.js` | Companies: several companies under one login (each in its own storage namespace with its own sync), company groups, members with roles (owner, admin, accountant, sales, viewer) and what each role may open and change, the company switcher, and Group Statements (consolidated Profit & Loss / Balance Sheet with inter-company eliminations) |

## Screens

Everything the app has:

- Dashboard with greeting, company chips, subscription status, monthly stats, recent products and the
  tiles Invoice, Sales, Items, Customer, Supplier, Purchase, Expense, Journal, Reports. The top bar carries
  Company Profile, Sales Report, Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, Stock in Hand, Export / Import, Subscription
  and Sync, with the sync status, company name and Logout on the right.
- Invoice editor: number with step buttons and owner-defined format, date, payment mode, RCM for service
  businesses, buyer and consignee blocks with contact pick-list, other details (transporter, delivery note,
  buyer order no and date, reference, info), item rows with HSN (filled from the item master or the
  well-known HSN names), GST %, inclusive-of-tax toggle, quantity, UQC, rate, product sub-details, totals
  with CGST/SGST or IGST by state, rounding and amount in words.
- Quick items: starter items for the line of activity plus the item master, with search, category chips
  (rename / remove), list or grid view, quantity steppers, per-invoice price and GST, add / customise /
  remove items.
- Printing: Save keeps the invoice and moves on to the next invoice number, Print / PDF prints straight away with the layout picked from previews under Print Settings (A4 unless changed); delivery challan for any invoice (also from the Challan button in Sales), envelopes
  (DL, C5, #10), purchase record / quotation, credit and debit notes; paper sizes A4 / A5 / Letter / Legal;
  e-way bill warning above ₹50,000 (₹1,00,000 in Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Bihar). The browser's
  print dialog saves the PDF. Every printout ends with "Powered by BlitzBook". While the print dialog is up the
  page title is the document number and date ("Invoice 0001 - 03/10/2026"), so a browser header line or the
  PDF's title shows that and not the portal's own title. On the Classic layout the last page fills the room
  above the totals with the item columns, so the totals, bank details and signature sit at the foot of the
  frame instead of a blank box following them.
- Terms & conditions and payment due date: the company profile holds the terms (one per line) and a credit
  period in days. Each invoice has *Include terms & conditions on the PDF* (on by default when terms exist)
  and a *Payment Due Date*; a Credit invoice gets the date filled in from the credit period until one is
  typed. Both layouts print the due date beside the payment mode and the numbered terms at the foot. The
  terms are kept with the invoice as saved (`due_date`, `terms` in the sync row; the app leaves them as they are).
- Delivery challans (Sales > Delivery Challans): goods sent out before or without an invoice, numbered
  DC-0001 onwards in the same editor (no rate needed), printed as a challan, turned into a Credit invoice with
  Make Invoice (the invoice carries the challan number under Delivery Note and the challan shows which
  invoice it became; deleting that invoice reopens the challan). They sync with the app as `dc:<no>`.
- Upload PO (Sales): a CSV / Excel file of customer purchase orders in the BlitzBook template (one row per
  item, PO Number on each row; a blank PO Number continues the row above; Rate is the price before GST,
  blank takes the item master price). A preview shows what each PO will do, then every PO becomes one Credit
  invoice: a PO number already on an invoice updates that invoice, the rest are inserted; customers and items
  are upserted into the masters. Dates may be dd/mm/yyyy, ISO or Excel serials.
- Every upload (contacts, stock, purchase orders, bank statement) offers the same choice for rows already in
  the books, **Upsert** (new rows are added, the ones already here are brought up to date) or **Insert only**
  (new rows only, the rest are left as they are; remembered as `upload_mode`), and ends with a result dialog
  counting what was *inserted*, *updated*, *unchanged* (identical already) and *skipped*, with the reasons.
  Contacts match by name, stock items by name among the lines uploaded earlier (upsert sets the file's
  quantity and rate; purchase-bill stock is never touched), purchase orders by PO number, statement lines by
  date, amount and narration (upsert updates the party and the bill the voucher is against).
- Credit notes must name their invoice and cannot exceed what is left of its value; an invoice with credit
  notes against it cannot be deleted until they are.
- Customers / suppliers with TDS settings, CSV or Excel upload in the app's template, bulk delete.
- Item master with codes, categories, bulk category / GST / delete; items invoiced or bought as stock join
  it automatically; removed starter items stay hidden.
- Purchases and quotations (convert to purchase), reverse charge, GST-inclusive rates, TDS from the
  supplier's record, stock flag per item; stock in hand with CSV / Excel upload of opening stock, delete
  one stock item or many at once (optionally from the item master too).
- Expenses with GST (bill value or taxable value), vendor GSTIN, reverse charge.
- Receipts & Payments: money received from a customer (against an invoice, with the outstanding balance
  shown) or any other income, money paid to a supplier (against a purchase) or any other outgoing; cash or
  bank with UPI / cheque reference; printable receipt voucher. Upload a bank statement (CSV or Excel export
  of any bank, or the template) and every line becomes a receipt or payment: parties are matched from the
  narration (and remembered for next time), lines already recorded are spotted on a re-upload.
- Journal vouchers with any number of debit and credit lines, auto-balancing, account picker with
  natures, create party / account in place. Receipts and payments appear here too.
- Sales report, Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet with the same lines and figures as the app, Excel export.
  Receivables and payables are party-wise: credit sales, credit purchases, notes on account and receipts /
  payments net off per customer or supplier, and each outstanding party is listed.

## Companies, groups and members

- **Companies** (top bar) lists every company the account owns or has been given a role in, grouped. *New
  company* makes another company owned by the account (its profile is then filled in under Company Profile);
  *Group / name* puts a company in a group; *Members* adds other BlitzBook accounts by mobile number or email
  with a role and changes or removes them; *Delete* (owner) removes a company with all its books; *Leave*
  drops a company one was invited to. The company chip in the top bar (and *Switch company* on the dashboard)
  switches between companies; the chip shows the role in another owner's company.
- Roles: **Owner** everything, members, subscription, deleting the company; **Admin** everything in the books,
  the profile and the members; **Accountant** every record of the books, not the profile or members; **Sales**
  sales invoices, delivery challans, credit / debit notes, receipts, customers and items; **Viewer** looks at
  everything, changes nothing. Screens and tiles a role cannot use are not offered; a save a role may not make
  is refused with a note, and the server refuses it as well.
- Each company has its own storage namespace in the browser and its own sync; the account's own first company
  is the one it always had. Everyone working in a company runs on its owner's subscription (shown under
  Subscription); AI Access belongs to the account and is offered in its own company only.
- **Group Statements** (top bar, Reports): choose a group or all companies, Profit & Loss for a period or
  Balance Sheet as at a date. The latest books of every company are fetched first; the table has a column per
  company, an Eliminations column when the companies dealt with each other (sales, purchases, credit / debit
  notes and balances between them, parties matched to companies by name) and the group total, with group
  ratios, Excel and PDF. Each company's GST stays its own.

## Sync with the app

The Supabase project URL and anon key are built into `js/sync.js` (`DEFAULT_SERVER_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`),
the same ones as in the app; a BlitzBook sync server address works there too. There is no sync screen or status
for users: it runs on its own. Log in with the account you use in the app
(or register here and log in there). Every entry, edit and
deletion on one side appears on the other within a few seconds while both are online; offline work is
sent when the connection returns. The status chip in the top bar shows Synced / Syncing / Offline /
This device only; clicking it opens the Sync dialog with the server address. See `server/README.md`.

## Data and backups

**Export / Import** writes and reads the same backup file as the app (Export / Import there), so a backup
taken here restores in the app and vice versa. Without sync the data is stored only in the browser you use,
so export regularly.

## Dashboard, ledger and search

- Every screen has its own address (`#sales`, `#invoice?id=...`, `#contacts?type=Supplier`,
  `#salesReport?from=01/10/2026&to=31/10/2026`): the back button walks back, a reload or a bookmark reopens
  the screen. Dialogs (Company Profile, Subscription) leave the address alone.

- The dashboard tiles (New Invoice, Purchases, Sales, Stock, Expense, Receipts, Payments, Journal, Customer,
  Supplier, Reports) can be dragged into any order: with a mouse straight away, on a touch screen after
  *Arrange* beside the heading. The order is kept per account in this browser (`tile_order`); *Reset order*
  brings the standard order back.
- **Party Ledger** (Reports menu, *Ledger* on a contact, *Supplier Ledger* under Purchases, *Party Ledger*
  under Receipts & Payments): every bill, note, receipt and payment with one supplier or customer in date
  order with a running balance, for a period or all dates, with Excel export, to reconcile with the party's
  own statement (`Books.partyLedger`).
- **Sales** has a search box: invoice number, date, party, phone, email, GSTIN, item name or amount; every
  word typed has to match.
- Every **Export Excel** has a **PDF** beside it (sales report, outstanding & ageing, party ledger, profit &
  loss, balance sheet): the same table laid out on pages by the print module and sent to the print dialog.
- Quick item and item master prices are the price the customer pays, GST included ("Unit Price (inclusive of
  tax)"); on the invoice the rate before GST is worked back out of it, so qty x rate x (1 + GST) lands on
  the price again. The same in the app.
- **Dark mode**: the moon / sun button in the top bar (and on the login page) switches the portal between
  light and dark; the choice is kept in the browser (`blitzbook.theme`) and, until one is made, the system
  setting decides. `index.html` applies it before the first paint. Printouts stay black on white.

## GST returns (GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B JSON)

**GST** in the top bar is shown to every account. It opens for accounts on a **yearly plan or longer**
(`Sub.isYearly`: a plan of 365 days or more applied here, by code, by payment or by a sync that stretched the
validity by a year, is remembered as `yearly_until`; an account activated elsewhere still counts while more
than 300 days of validity remain); everyone else gets a *Yearly subscription required* dialog with the plans.
A regular GST registration is needed (composition dealers file CMP-08 / GSTR-4).

Pick the return period (a month, or a quarter for quarterly filers; the month gone by is offered first). The
screen fetches the sales invoices, credit notes, purchases and expenses dated in it and shows the GSTR-1 and
GSTR-3B figures, the documents with the GSTR-1 table each lands in, and anything to check (an invalid buyer
GSTIN, missing HSN codes, B2C credit notes exceeding the sales). **GSTR-1 JSON** and **GSTR-3B JSON** download
`GSTR1_<GSTIN>_<MMYYYY>.json` and `GSTR3B_<GSTIN>_<MMYYYY>.json` in the layout of the GST portal's Returns
Offline Tool (open the file there, check and upload):

- GSTR-1, in the layout of the portal's own `returns_<date>_R1_<GSTIN>_offline_others_0.json` file: `gstin`,
  `fp`, `filing_typ` (M or Q), `gt` and `cur_gt` (turnover of the previous and the current financial year from
  the books), the supply tables, `doc_issue` with all twelve document types and `fil_dt`; then
  `b2b` (registered buyers, invoice by invoice, rate-wise lines, reverse charge flagged), `b2cl`
  (inter-state invoices above ₹1,00,000 to unregistered buyers), `b2cs` (every other sale summed by state and
  rate, net of the credit notes against such sales), `cdnr` (credit notes to registered buyers), `cdnur`
  (credit notes against B2CL invoices), `nil` (0% lines by supply type), `hsn` (table 12 by HSN, rate and
  unit) and `doc_issue` (invoices, credit notes and delivery challans issued). Nil-rated lines are left out of
  tables 4, 5 and 7, as the rules say.
- GSTR-3B: 3.1(a) outward taxable supplies net of credit notes (reverse-charge sales excluded, the buyer pays
  that tax), 3.1(c) nil-rated, 3.1(d) inward supplies under reverse charge (purchases and expenses marked
  RCM), 3.2 inter-state supplies to unregistered persons by state, 4(A)(3) ITC on reverse charge and 4(A)(5)
  all other ITC net of debit notes. Imports, ISD credit, reversals, interest and late fee are written as zero.

The figures come from what is in the books; always check the files in the offline tool before filing.

## Installing the portal as an app

`manifest.webmanifest`, `icons/` and the service worker `sw.js` make the portal installable: Chrome (Android and
desktop) offers *Install app*, and on iPhone / iPad Safari's *Share → Add to Home Screen* adds it to the home
screen, where it opens full screen with the same login and books. Once opened it works offline too (the books
are in the browser's storage; sync catches up when online). The **Android App** and **iOS App** buttons in the top bar
offer the APK and these iPhone / iPad steps. The native iPhone / iPad app (a shell around this portal) is in
`../ios/`; `js/native.js` is the bridge it uses for printing and downloads.

## Activation codes

The plans are a monthly plan (30 days), a yearly plan (365), a 2 years plan (730), a 5 years plan (1825), and
invoice packs of 15 invoices (valid 3 months) and 40 invoices (valid 6 months). A time plan opens every feature.
On an invoice pack every saved invoice, credit note or debit note uses one invoice, invoices not used by the pack's
date lapse, the portal then shows only invoicing (New Invoice,
Sales, Credit Notes, Debit Notes, Customer, Supplier, Sales Report), and a saved invoice or note is read-only
(`Sub.isLite`). Codes handed to customers are issued in Supabase and work once on any account:
`server/supabase/activation.sql` loads ten of each (listed in `server/supabase/activation-codes.txt`). A code tied to one login can also be
made offline, exactly as for the Android app:

```
java tools/LicenceKeyGen.java <mobile-or-email> <days>
```

Days can be 30, 365, 730 or 1825. The identity must be what the user registered with.

## Tests

- `node server/test.js` — sync protocol and data layout, no browser needed.
- `node server/supabase/test.js` — the Supabase backend against a stand-in for the Supabase API.
- `node server/supabase/mcp-test.js` — the MCP server (AI Access) against a stand-in for the database; what it saves is
  read back through `js/appformat.js`.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_CORE=/path/to/playwright-core node tools/po-challan.js` — purchase-order upload (upsert and
  insert only, result counts), delivery challans, their printing, sync records and backup, terms & conditions
  and the due date on the PDF, the GST lock and the GSTR-1 / GSTR-3B JSON, dark mode, in a portal opened as a file.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_CORE=/path/to/playwright-core node tools/smoke.js` — drives the portal in Chromium through
  every screen, then a second browser signs in to the same account and both must stay in step.
- `node server/supabase/companies-test.js` — companies, groups, roles and the group statements against a stand-in
  for Supabase that applies the rules of `companies.sql` (`server/supabase/standin.js`).
- `PLAYWRIGHT_CORE=/path/to/playwright-core node tools/companies.js` — the Companies, switcher, members and Group
  Statements screens in Chromium, an owner and a member with changing roles, against the same stand-in.

## Customising

- Company colours: edit the `:root` variables at the top of `css/app.css`.
- Font: `index.html` loads Plus Jakarta Sans from Google Fonts. Offline, or if you remove that link, the
  portal uses the system font.
- Plans, prices, UPI ID, vendor phone and activation server: top of `js/subscription.js`.
- Supabase project URL and anon key, or the sync server address: top of `js/sync.js`.
- Invoice number format: Company Profile, for example `INV/{FY}/####`.
